;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the minor mode `auto-compile-on-save-mode' which
;; automatically compiles Emacs Lisp code when the visiting buffers are
;; saved to their source files, provided that the respective byte code
;; files already exists.  If the byte code file does not already exist
;; nothing is done.  Also provided is `auto-compile-on-load-mode' which
;; is described toward the end of this commentary.

;; To start or stop compiling a source file or multiple files at once use
;; the command `toggle-auto-compile' which toggles automatic compilation
;; by either compiling the selected source file(s) or by removing the
;; respective byte code file(s).  The appropriate action is determined by
;; the existence respectively absence of the byte code file.

;; Automatically compiling Emacs Lisp source files after each save is
;; useful for at least the following reasons:

;; * Emacs prefers the byte code file over the source file even if the
;;   former is outdated.  Without a mode which automatically recompiles
;;   the source files you will at least occasionally forget to do so
;;   manually and end up with an old version of your code being loaded.

;; * There are many otherwise fine libraries to be found on the Internet
;;   which when compiled will confront the user with a wall of compile
;;   warnings and an occasional error.  If authors are informed about
;;   these (often trivial) problems after each save they will likely fix
;;   them quite quickly.  That or they have a high noise tolerance.

;; * It's often easier and less annoying to fix errors and warnings as
;;   they are introduced than to do a "let's compile today's work and see
;;   how it goes".

;; So do yourself and others a favor and enable this mode by adding the
;; following to your init file:
;;
;;     (auto-compile-on-save-mode 1)

;; Auto-Compile mode is designed to stay out of your way as much as it
;; can while still motivating you to get things fixed.  But Auto-Compile
;; mode can also be configured to be more insistent, which might be
;; annoying initially but less so once existing problems have been fixed.

;; Occasionally you might be tempted to turn of Auto-Compile mode locally
;; because you are doing some work which causes lots of expected warnings
;; until you are actually done.  Don't do so: because Emacs prefers the
;; byte code file you would also have to remove that, in which case you
;; don't have to turn of this mode anymore.  In other words use the
;; command `toggle-auto-compile' instead.

;; Even when using `auto-compile-mode' it can sometimes happen that the
;; source file is newer than the byte compile destination.  This can for
;; example happen when performing version control operations. To ensure
;; that byte code files are always up-to-date when being loaded using
;; `require' and `load' enable `auto-compile-on-load-mode' which advises
;; this functions to recompile the source files when needed.  Enable this
;; mode before any potentially byte compiled files are loaded by beginning
;; your init file with:
;;
;;     ;; -*- no-byte-compile: t -*-
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/auto-compile")
;;     (require 'auto-compile)
;;     (auto-compile-on-load-mode 1)
;;     (auto-compile-on-save-mode 1)

;; Also note that just because no warnings and/or errors are reported when
;; Auto-Compile mode compiles a source file this does not necessarily mean
;; that users of your libraries won't see any.  A likely cause for this
;; would be that you forgot to require a feature which is loaded on your
;; system but not necessarily on the users' systems.  So you should still
;; manually compile your packages before release:
;;
;;     emacs -batch -q --no-site-file \
;;       -L . -L ../dependency/ -f batch-byte-compile *.el

selected then all source files in that directory will have their status
set, otherwise just the selected file.

Toggling happens by either compiling the source files(s) or by removing
the respective byte code file(s).  See `auto-compile-mode'.

The appropriate action is determined by the existence respectively absence
of the byte code file for the selected source file.  If a directory was
selected but a source file was current when this command was invoked
use that file to determine the action.  Otherwise prompt the user.

To explicitly select an action use a positive prefix argument to compile
the source file(s) or a negative prefix argument to remove the respective
byte code file(s).

Note that even when a directory was selected, the action is determined
only once and then applied to all source files regardless of the presence
