* v2.0.3    2024-08-05

- Thoughts and whitespace.

* v2.0.2    2024-06-23

- Fixed the fix from the previous release, which is necessary for
  font-lock to be enable for Emacs 30 but keeps it from being
  enabled for older releases.

* v2.0.1    2024-06-08

- Fixed an issue that prevented \"Compile-Log\" from being fontified
  in Emacs 30.  4a951af

* v2.0.0    2024-03-21

At least Emacs 26.1 is required now.

- Fixed an issue that occurred when the init file is being
  compiled during Emacs startup.  ~startup--load-user-init-file~ binds
  ~user-init-file~ to a special value to instruct ~byte-compile-file~ to
  behave differently.  We didn't account for that, resulting in some
  other library that our advise loads (most likely ~compile.el~) to be
  treated as the init file.  #33

- When trying to remove an element from the mode-line, which happens
  to come last in a list, we ended up replacing it with nil, instead
  of completely removing it.  3899157
